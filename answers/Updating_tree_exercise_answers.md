**Q Do any of these lineages have known anti-microbial resistance genes?**

Yes, they all do!

**Q** *Are our new sequences (SRR19310037, SRR19310038, and SRR19127720) closely related in the ML tree?*

Nope!

**Q** *Are our new sequences (SRR19310037, SRR19310038, and SRR19127720) closely related in the bootstrap consensus tree?*

Also no


**Q What do these relationships suggest about if this is a new outbreak cluster, or endemic variation?**

These seem to be from endemic varaition.


**Q** *Does changing the reference taxon change the sequences?*

Yes! 113 - 141 bases are different calls for SRR19127720, and there are many (over 47,000!) gaps and or ambiguities that are not shared.

**Q Does changing the reference taxon change the phylogeny or inferences you would make from it?**

Nope!
